Apparently, symmetries aren't a thing. 
So don't use symmetries this time.

Todo:

	Bug:
		I'm pretty sure I have a bug where the iGo class isn't recognizing things as "sensible moves" when there's just a single liberty. specifically, I've seen the following a few times:
		 O  -  O  -  O  O  O 
		 O  O  O  O  O  O  - 
		 O  -  O  O  O  O  O 
		 O  O  -  O  O  -  O 
		 O  O  O  O  -  O  O 
		 O  O  O  X  X  O  O 
		 O  -  O  O  O  -  O 		
		For example, both the random agent and the vanilla mcts agent (with 100 rollouts) passed on this board. 
		There's clearly a black group that can be captured, so there may be a bug in my "get sensible moves" function.
		A bug in this function predicts that I should find the same thing in my random rollouts, too, so I can write a test for that.





	5) try and figure out how to install dl4j and load/do inference with a keras model trained in python
